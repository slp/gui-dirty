This is version 0.1.1 of the GNUstep GUI library (`libgnustep-gui').

   Here is some introductory info to get you started:

Initial reading
===============

   * The file `ANNOUNCE' contains a very brief overview of the library.
     It also tells you where to get the most recent version.

   * The file `NEWS' has the library's feature history.

   * The file `INSTALL' gives instructions for installing the library.

How can you help?
=================

   * Read the projects and questions in the `TODO' file.  If you can
     volunteer for any of the projects, or if you have any useful
     comments send me email!  <scottc@net-community.com>

   * Give me feedback!  Tell me what you like; tell me what you think
     could be better.  Send me bug reports.

Creators rejoice!
