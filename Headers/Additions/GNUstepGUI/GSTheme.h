    <heading>The theme management system</heading>
    <p>
      The theme management system for the GNUstep GUI is based around the
      [GSTheme] class, which provides support for loading of theme bundles
      and methods for drawing common user interface elements.<br />
      The theme system works in conjunction with a variety of other GUI
      classes and is intended to eventually allow for very major changes
      in GUI appearance and behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various design imperatives apply to the theme system, but probably
      the key ones are:
    </p>
    <list>
      <item>It should allow designers and other non-technical users to
        easily develop new and interesting GUI styles likely to attract
	new users to GNUstep.
      </item>
      <item>Using and switching between themes should be an easy and
        pleasant experience ... so that people are not put off when they
        try using themes.
      </item>
      <item>It should eventually permit a GNUstep application to
        appear as a native application on ms-windows and other systems.
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>
      To attain these aims implies the recognition of some more specific
      objectives and some possible technical solutions:
    </p>
    <list>
      <item>We must have as simple as possible an API for the
        functions handling the way GUI elements work and the way they
	draw themselves.<br />
	The standard OpenStep/MacOS-X API provides mechanisms for
	controlling the colors used to draw controls (via [NSColor] and
	[NSColorList]) and controlling the way controls behave
	(NSInterfaceStyleForKey() and [NSResponder-interfaceStyle]),
	but we need to extend that with methods to draw controls entirely
	differently if required.
      </item>
      <item>We must have a GUI application for theme development.
        It is not sufficient to provide an API if we want good graphic
	designers and user interface specialists to develop themes
	for us.
      </item>
      <item>It must be possible for an application to dynamically change
        the theme in use while it is running and it should be easy for a
	user to select between available themes.<br />
	This implies that themes must be loadable bundles and that it
	must always be possible to unload a theme as well as loading one.<br />
	It suggests that the theme selection mechanism should be in every
	application, perhaps as an extension to an existing panel such
	as the info panel.
      </item>
    </list>
    <section>
      <heading>Types of theming</heading>
      <p>
        There are various aspects of theming which can be treated pretty
	much separately, so there is no reason why a theme might not be
	created which just employs one of these mechanisms.
      </p>
      <deflist>
	<term>System images</term>
	<desc>
	  Possibly the simples theme change ... a theme might supply a
	  new set of system images used for arrows and other icons that
	  the GUI decorates controls with.
	</desc>
        <term>System colors</term>
	<desc>
	  A theme might simply define a new system color list, so that
	  controls are drawn in a new color range, though they would
	  still function the same way.  Even specifying new colors can
	  make the GUI look quite different though.
	</desc>
	<term>Image tiling</term>
	<desc>
	  Controls might be given sets of images used as tiling to draw
	  themselves rather than using the standard line drawing and
	  color fill mechanisms.
	</desc>
	<term>Interface style</term>
	<desc>
	  A theme might supply a set of interface style keys for various
	  controls, defining how those controls should behave subject to
	  the limitation of the range of behaviors coded into the GUI
	  library.
	</desc>
	<term>Method override</term>
	<desc>
	  A theme might actually provide code, in the form of a subclass
	  of [GSTheme] such that drawing methods have completely custom
	  behavior.
	</desc>
      </deflist>

/**
  <p><em>This interface is <strong>HIGHLY</strong> unstable

  </p>
  <p>
  This is a class used for 'theming', which is mostly a matter of
  encapsulating common drawing behaviors so that GUI appearance can
  be easily modified, but also includes mechanisms for altering
  some GUI behavior (such as orientation and position of menus).
  </p>
  <p>
  Methods in this class standardize drawing of buttons, borders
  and other common GUI elements, so that all other classes within
  the GUI will provide a consistent appearance by using these
  methods.
  </p>
  <p>
  The default implementation uses the standard configurable colors
  defined in NSColor, such as <code>controlLightHighlightColor</code>,
  <code>controlShadowColor</code> and <code>controlDarkShadowColor</code>.<br />
  Themes are expected to override the default system color list with their
  own versions, and this class cooperates with [NSColor] and [NSColorList]
  to establish the correct system color list when a theme is activated.
  </p>
  <p>
  The class provides a mechanism for automatic loading of theme bundles
  consisting of resources used to define how drawing is done, plus an
  optional binary subclass of this class (to replace/extend the drawing
  methods this class provides).
  </p>
  <p>
  In future this class should provide mechanisms to draw controls by
  tiling of images, and provide control over GUI behavior by controlling
  the values returned by NSInterfaceStyleForKey() so that controls
  use the appropriate behavior.
