Projects Looking for Volunteers
===============================

If you think you can do one of these projects, please let me know.  Your
help is greatly appreciated.  Send email to <scottc@net-community.com>.

   * Write code!  The GNUstep GUI Library is far from complete, so
     there are plenty of areas awaiting contribution.

   * Printing architecture.  Careful thoughts needs to go into how the
     printing capabilities can be done in the most portable way,
     possibly take into consideration systems that don't support the
     Display Ghostscript System and/or printing to non-Postscript
     printers.

   * Drag and drop/pasteboard framework.  Is there a way this can be
     done so that all GNU programs can take advantage of it and not
     just GNUstep?  That would be optimal because GNUstep and
     non-GNUstep programs would then be able to partially interoperate.

   * Expand the image handling capabilities beyond OPENSTEP.  There is
     no reason why we must limit ourselves to EPS and TIFF bitmaps, we
     should have image representations for as many bitmap formats as
     possible; excluding GIF files which are currently restricted by
     patents.

   * The spell server and checker; along with this would be to create an
     interface with the GNU Dictionary project.

   * GNUstep window manager.  Though not part of the GUI Library per
     se, an X Window manager that gives the complete desktop the
     GNUstep look and feel would be a great thing to have.
