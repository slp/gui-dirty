This is version 0.3.0 of the GNUstep GUI library (`gnustep-gui').

What is the GNUstep GUI Library?
================================

   It is a library of graphical user interface classes written
completely in the Objective-C language; the classes are based upon the
OpenStep specification as release by NeXT Software, Inc.  The library
does not completely conform to the specification and has been enhanced
in a number of ways to take advantage of the GNU system.  These classes
include graphical objects such as buttons, text fields, popup lists,
browser lists, and windows; there are also many associated classes for
handling events, colors, fonts, pasteboards and images.

   The GNUstep GUI Library is designed in two parts.  The first part is
the front-end component which is independent of platform and display
system.  This front-end is combined with a back-end component which
handles all of the display system dependent such as specific calls to
X/Windows.  This design allows the GNUstep applications to have the
"look and feel" of the underlying display system without any changes to
the application, and the library can be easily ported to other display
systems.

   The GNUstep GUI Library requires the GNU Objective-C compiler, the
GNUstep Base Library, the TIFF Graphics library, and a back-end
component like the GNUstep X/DPS GUI Backend.

What's new in this release?
===========================

   The currently released version of the library is `0.3.0'.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.3.0'
=====================================

   * Completely reworked the menu class. The NSMenu class is now
     inherited from NSObject and using the new implementation menus
     have been implemented for the XDPS backend (they have the look and
     feel of the NeXTStep menus!).

   * NSRunLoop has been integrated with NSApplication. Using this
     capability time events have been implemented to NSEvent class.
     These events allow several improvements in the interaction between
     user and the graphic interface.

   * NSMatrix has been reworked, it is now conforming to the OpenStep
     specification and it knows all the selection modes. It uses time
     events to enhance the drawing speed during mouse drags.

   * The initial implementation of NSForm has been made although it has
     not been tested yet.

   * NSPrinter has been implemented though it was not throughly tested;
     thanks to Simon Frankau.

   * Configure script has been changed to detect the underlaying
     Foundation library.  The currently supported libraries are
     gnustep-base and libFoundation.

   * Several cleanups have been made in a lot of classes: the
     retain/release policy has been fixed, the cell classes correctly
     implement the NSCopying protocol and many others.

How can I get support for this software?
========================================

   We currently do not have a mailing list setup explicitly for the
GNUstep GUI Library; however, you may wish to use the GNUstep
discussion mailing list for general questions and discussion.  Look at
the GNUstep Web Pages for more information regarding GNUstep resources
`http://www.gnustep.org'

   There are also companies which provide commercial support for the
GNUstep GUI Library, see the file `SUPPORT' for more information.

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

   The gstep-gui-0.3.0.tar.gz distribution file has been placed on
`ftp.gnustep.org' in `pub/gnustep'.

   The program requires gcc 2.7.0 or higher.

   It requires the Display Ghostscript System version 0.2.0 and the
TIFF Graphics library version 3.4.

   It also requires a FoundationKit library as specified by the OpenStep
specification.  The FoundationKit libraries known to work are the
GNUstep Base Library version `0.2.12' and libFoundation version
`0.7.1'.

   The `.tar' file is compressed with GNU gzip.  Gzip can be obtained by
anonymous ftp at any of the GNU archive sites.

   For info about FTP via email, send email to <ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com>
with no subject line, and two-line body with line one `help' and line
two `quit'.

   The most recent (not necessarily tested) snapshots of the library
will be placed in
`ftp://alpha.gnu.ai.mit.edu/gnu/gnustep'.

Where do I send bug reports?
============================

   Bug reports can be sent to the GNUstep discussion list
<discussion@gnustep.org> or to NET-Community Technical Support
<support@net-community.com>.

Creators rejoice!

   [ Most GNU software is packed using the GNU `gzip' compression
program.    Source code is available on most sites distributing GNU
software.

   For information on how to order GNU software on tape, floppy or
cd-rom, or   printed GNU manuals, check the file etc/ORDERS in the GNU
Emacs distribution   or in GNUinfo/ORDERS on prep, or e-mail a request
