This is version 0.6.7 of the GNUstep GUI library (`gnustep-gui').

What is the GNUstep GUI Library?
================================

   It is a library of graphical user interface classes written
completely in the Objective-C language; the classes are based upon the
OpenStep specification as release by NeXT Software, Inc.  The library
does not completely conform to the specification and has been enhanced
in a number of ways to take advantage of the GNU system.  These classes
include graphical objects such as buttons, text fields, popup lists,
browser lists, and windows; there are also many associated classes for
handling events, colors, fonts, pasteboards and images.

   The GNUstep GUI Library is designed in two parts.  The first part is
the front-end component which is independent of platform and display
system.  This front-end is combined with a back-end component which
handles all of the display system dependent such as specific calls to
X/Windows.  This design allows the GNUstep applications to have the
"look and feel" of the underlying display system without any changes to
the application, and the library can be easily ported to other display
systems.

   The GNUstep GUI Library requires the GNU Objective-C compiler, the
GNUstep Base Library, the TIFF Graphics library, and a back-end
component like the GNUstep X/DPS GUI Backend.

How can I get support for this software?
========================================

   We currently do not have a mailing list setup explicitly for the
GNUstep GUI Library; however, you may wish to use the GNUstep
discussion mailing list for general questions and discussion.  Look at
the GNUstep Web Pages for more information regarding GNUstep resources
<http://www.gnustep.org/>

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

   The gstep-gui-0.6.7.tar.gz distribution file has been placed on
`ftp.gnustep.org' in `pub/gnustep/core'.

   The program requires gcc 2.8.0 or higher.

   The Display Ghostscript System version 0.5.10 and the TIFF Graphics
library version 3.4 may be required depending on the backend you choose.

   It also requires a FoundationKit library as specified by the OpenStep
specification.  The FoundationKit libraries known to work are the
GNUstep Base Library version `0.6.6'.

   The `.tar' file is compressed with GNU gzip.  Gzip can be obtained by
anonymous ftp at any of the GNU archive sites.

   For info about FTP via email, send email to <ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com>
with no subject line, and two-line body with line one `help' and line
two `quit'.

   The most recent (not necessarily tested) snapshots of the library
will be placed in <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gnustep>.
