GNUstep GUI Library NEWS
************************

The currently released version of the library is `0.1.0'

Noteworthy changes in version `0.1.0'
======================================

   * Integration of the GNUstep X/DPS GUI Backend.  This has finally
     produced a set of core code with can display on X/Windows.
     Much of the X/Windows code has been written by Pascal Forget 
     <pascal@wsc.com> and integration efforts have been lead by Scott
     Christley <scottc@net-community.com>.

   * Some major directory reorganization for the new naming guidelines.
     Headers previously in AppKit and DPSClient directories have been moved
     to gnustep/gui and gnustep/dps directores and symbol links are
     created for the AppKit and DPSClient directories.  This should allow
     both GNUstep and other OpenStep implementations to reside on the
     same machine without conflicts.
