The currently released version of the library is `0.1.1'.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.1.1'
=====================================

   * Almost complete implementation of the PXKMenu and PXKMenuCell
     classes.

   * Fill out implementation of NSFont and NSFontManager.

   * Fill out implementation of NSColor including color spaces other
     than RGB.  Now maintains the common colors as global variables.

   * Integration with the Display Ghostscript System.  This is mainly
     related to using the header files in the DPSclient library for
     defining the PostScript operator functions.

   * Initial documentation set.

   * Initial implementation of NSImage, NSImageRep, and NSImageRep
     subclass classes based upon work by Adam Fedor.

   * Now requires the TIFF library for reading, writing, and
     manipulating tiff files and images.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.1.0'
=====================================

   * Integration of the GNUstep X/DPS GUI Backend.  This has finally
     produced a set of core code with can display on X/Windows.  Much
     of the X/Windows code has been written by Pascal Forget
     <pascal@wsc.com> and integration efforts have been lead by Scott
     Christley <scottc@net-community.com>.

   * Some major directory reorganization for the new naming guidelines.
     Headers previously in AppKit and DPSClient directories have been
     moved to gnustep/gui and gnustep/dps directores and symbol links
     are created for the AppKit and DPSClient directories.  This should
     allow both GNUstep and other OpenStep implementations to reside on
     the same machine without conflicts.
