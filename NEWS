The currently released version of the library is `0.2.0'.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.2.0'
=====================================

   * Additional NSImage and NSImageRep class work.  Incorporated common
     images for use with controls that were designed by Andrew Lindesay.

   * Fill out implementation of NSColorWell class.

   * Fill out implementation of NSColorList class.

   * Cleaned up the header files and added missing headers, methods,
     categories, and protocols; thanks to Simon Frankau for much of this
     work.  Major reorganization of header files.  Types and constants
     were moved in the files they belong.  Each header file includes
     only the headers it really needs.  Use `@class' to forward class
     definitions instead of including the corresponding class file.

   * Completely reworked the NSFont and NSFontManager classes so that
     NSUserDefaults is used for getting defaults and list of known
     fonts are maintained.

   * Initial implementation of NSCursor class.

   * Almost complete implementation of NSButton and NSButtonCell class.
     Buttons can not display images and/or text, handles all of the
     OpenStep button types and styles.

   * Fill out implementation of NSScroller class.

   * Put in underlying support for optimizing drawing; flushing of
     windows, backing store, and only display when needed.

   * Many bug fixes and minor enhancements.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.1.1'
=====================================

   * Almost complete implementation of the PXKMenu and PXKMenuCell
     classes.

   * Fill out implementation of NSFont and NSFontManager.

   * Fill out implementation of NSColor including color spaces other
     than RGB.  Now maintains the common colors as global variables.

   * Integration with the Display Ghostscript System.  This is mainly
     related to using the header files in the DPSclient library for
     defining the PostScript operator functions.

   * Initial documentation set.

   * Initial implementation of NSImage, NSImageRep, and NSImageRep
     subclass classes based upon work by Adam Fedor.

   * Now requires the TIFF library for reading, writing, and
     manipulating tiff files and images.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.1.0'
=====================================

   * Integration of the GNUstep X/DPS GUI Backend.  This has finally
     produced a set of core code with can display on X/Windows.  Much
     of the X/Windows code has been written by Pascal Forget
     <pascal@wsc.com> and integration efforts have been lead by Scott
     Christley <scottc@net-community.com>.

   * Some major directory reorganization for the new naming guidelines.
     Headers previously in AppKit and DPSClient directories have been
     moved to gnustep/gui and gnustep/dps directores and symbol links
     are created for the AppKit and DPSClient directories.  This should
     allow both GNUstep and other OpenStep implementations to reside on
     the same machine without conflicts.
