@itemize @bullet

@item Consolodate examples and tests [3, OpenStep] (980913).
Also fix or document whatever bugs are there.

@item Need an rtf parser [6 - Objective-C, RTF] (980820).

@item
Expand the image handling capabilities beyond OpenStep.  There is no
reason why we must limit ourselves to EPS and TIFF bitmaps, we should
have image representations for as many bitmap formats as possible;
excluding GIF files which are currently restricted by patents.

@item
The spell server and checker; along with this would be to create an
interface with the GNU Dictionary project.
