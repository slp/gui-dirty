@section Projects Looking for Volunteers

If you think you can do one of these projects, please let me know.  Your
help is greatly appreciated.  Send email to @email{scottc@@net-community.com}. 

@itemize @bullet

@item
Write code!  The GNUstep GUI Library is far from complete, so there are
plenty of areas awaiting contribution.

@item
Printing architecture.  Careful thoughts needs to go into how the
printing capabilities can be done in the most portable way, possibly
take into consideration systems that don't support the Display
Ghostscript System and/or printing to non-Postscript printers.

@item
Drag and drop/pasteboard framework.  Is there a way this can be done so
that all GNU programs can take advantage of it and not just GNUstep?
That would be optimal because GNUstep and non-GNUstep programs would then
be able to partially interoperate.

@item
Expand the image handling capabilities beyond OPENSTEP.  There is no
reason why we must limit ourselves to EPS and TIFF bitmaps, we should
have image representations for as many bitmap formats as possible;
excluding GIF files which are currently restricted by patents.

@item
The spell server and checker; along with this would be to create an
interface with the GNU Dictionary project.

@item
GNUstep window manager.  Though not part of the GUI Library per se, an X
Window manager that gives the complete desktop the GNUstep look and feel
would be a great thing to have.
