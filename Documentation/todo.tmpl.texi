@subsection Windows

@itemize @bullet
@item Code to manage window decorations is not finished.  
The reported frame origin of a window might be wrong. 

@item Windows never get released.  Setting isReleasedWhenClosed 
does not work.

Fixing these bugs requires touching delicate parts of the library.
This is why fixing them has been postponed after 0.6.5, to keep 0.6.5
reasonably stable.

@subsection Texts

@itemize @bullet
@item The NSText code is particularly complex to work on and it has not 
improved much since 0.6.0.  Many bugs are know in the code -- it is 
somewhat usable though.  We hope on a big improvement of this area 
for next release.
@end itemize

@subsection Matrices

@itemize @bullet
@item Encoding/Decoding of matrices is unimplemented.  There are some minor 
known bugs with handling of mouse down in matrices.
@end itemize

@subsection Cells

@itemize @bullet
@item Since NSText does only left alignment, when you select or edit text 
in a cell it becomes automatically left aligned regardless of the original 
alignment.

@item Multi line texts are unsupported; isScrollable, wordWraps etc do nothing.
This restriction will hopefully be removed in next releases.
@end itemize

@subsection Images anf Graphics

@itemize @bullet
@item There are problems with alpha composing.  To avoid these problems, 
you may set manually the background color of your image when displaying it.

@item Only TIFF images are supported in 0.6.5.  Support at least for PNG and 
JPEG images is planned for next release.

@item alpha drawing and compositing of graphics doesn't work.

@end itemize

@subsection Alert, Info Panels

@itemize @bullet
@item Multi line messages are generally unsupported due to the similar 
restriction in the cells code.
@end itemize
