@subsection Windows

@itemize @bullet
@item Getting and releasing keyboard focus is still buggy. This is mostly
annoying for users trying to type in a GNUstep or non-GNUstep window.

@end itemize

@subsection Texts

@itemize @bullet

@item There have been a lot of improvements in the NSText code, but is 
particularly complex. It is 
somewhat usable though.  We hope to keep improving it.

@end itemize

@subsection Matrices

@itemize @bullet
@item Encoding/Decoding of matrices is unimplemented.  There are some minor 
known bugs with handling of mouse down in matrices.
@end itemize

@subsection Cells

@itemize @bullet
@item Since NSText does only left alignment, when you select or edit text 
in a cell it becomes automatically left aligned regardless of the original 
alignment.

@item Multi line texts are unsupported; isScrollable, wordWraps etc do nothing.
This restriction will hopefully be removed in next releases.
@end itemize

@subsection Images anf Graphics

@itemize @bullet
@item There are problems with alpha composing.  To avoid these problems, 
you may set manually the background color of your image when displaying it.

@item alpha drawing and compositing of graphics works, but only to a limited
degree.

@end itemize

@subsection Alert, Info Panels

@itemize @bullet
@item Multi line messages are generally unsupported due to the similar 
restriction in the cells code.
@end itemize

to such a degree to be unusable.

@itemize @bullet
