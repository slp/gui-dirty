@section Noteworthy changes in version @samp{0.1.0}

@itemize @bullet

@item
Integration of the GNUstep X/DPS GUI Backend.  This has finally
produced a set of core code with can display on X/Windows.
Much of the X/Windows code has been written by Pascal Forget 
@email{pascal@@wsc.com} and integration efforts have been lead by Scott
Christley @email{scottc@@net-community.com}.

@item
Some major directory reorganization for the new naming guidelines.
Headers previously in AppKit and DPSClient directories have been moved
to gnustep/gui and gnustep/dps directores and symbol links are
created for the AppKit and DPSClient directories.  This should allow
both GNUstep and other OpenStep implementations to reside on the
same machine without conflicts.
