<p>

        NSTableColumn objects represent columns in
        NSTableViews.
      </p>
<h3><a name ="cont-1">The Column Identifier</a></h3>
<p>

          Each NSTableColumn object is identified by an object,
          called the column identifier. The reason is that,
          after a column has been added to a table view, the user
          might move the columns around, so there is a need to
          identify the columns regardless of their position in
          the table.
        </p>
<p>

          The identifier is typically a string describing the
          column. This identifier object is never displayed to
          the user ! It is only used internally by the program to
          identify the column - so yes, you may use a funny
          string for it and nobody will know, except people
          reading the code.
        </p>
<h3><a name ="cont-2">
          Information Stored in an NSTableColumn Object
        </a></h3>
<p>

          An NSTableColumn object mainly keeps information about the
          width of the column, its minimum and maximum width;
          whether the column can be edited or resized; and the
          cells used to draw the column header and the data in
          the column. You can change all these attributes of the
          column by calling the appropriate methods. Please note
          that the table column does not hold nor has access to
          the data to be displayed in the column; this data is
          maintained in the table view's data source, as
          described in the NSTableView documentation. A last
          hint: to set the title of a table column, ask the table
          column for its header cell, and set the string value
          of this header cell to the desired title.
