<h2><a name="cont-0">Preface</a></h2>
<p>

            This is a simple introduction to the GNUstep GUI library
            API.  If you know nothing about the OPENSTEP AppKit, it
            could be a good idea to read this before you start reading
            the reference documentation.
          </p>

            I am very interested in comments regarding this text,
            particularly from people who are new to the OPENSTEP
            AppKit API.  Send comments and/or suggestions to 
            
            [Nicola Pero, n.pero@mi.flashnet.it].

<h2><a name="cont-1">Basic Classes</a></h2>
<h3><a name="cont-2">NSView</a></h3>
<p>
 
              NSView is the class of objects representing a
              rectangular area (usually in a window) with its own
              coordinate system.  Views have methods to draw inside
              the view, to change the view's coordinate system, and to
              place the view with arbitrary position and size inside
              another view.  When you place a view inside another
              view, you are technically making the smaller view a
              <em>subview</em> of the bigger view.  The whole drawable
              area inside the window itself is represented by a view,
              called the <em>content view</em>.  All the visible views
              in a window are then subviews of the content view of
              that window (or of the content view's subviews etc).
              This gives rise to what is called the "view tree" of the
              window.

<h3><a name="cont-3">NSCell</a></h3>
<p>
              
              NSCell is the class of objects representing a single
              amount of displayable data.  For example, a cell could
              represent a number, or a string, or an image.  Cells
              have methods to draw the data they represent in a view,
              to change the way the data is to be drawn (eg the font
              for a string or the border for an image), and to let the
              user interact directly (eg editing the data) with the
              data in a view.
            </p>
<h3><a name="cont-4">NSControl</a></h3>
<p>

              NSControl is the class of objects representing a view
              (i.e., a rectangular area in a window) used to manage
              one or more cells (i.e., some displayable data).  This
              class is usually designed to work with a subclass of
              NSCell, called <em>NSActionCell</em>, through a system
              of target/action.  Each actioncell has a <em>target</em>
              - an object - and an <em>action</em> - a selector - both
              of which can be arbitrarily set.  The control can then
              ask the cell to send its action to its target (ie, to
              invoke the method of the target object identified by the
              selector) as a consequence of user actions in the
              control.  The typical example is a button: a button is a
              control with a corresponding cell; when the user presses
              the button, the buttoncell sends its action to its
              target.  Controls are the high-level objects the you
              usually deal with when designing everyday-life user
              interfaces.  You do not usually need to bother about
              cells, because the controls manage the cells for you.
