<h2><a name ="cont-0">Defaults Summary</a></h2>
<p>

        This document contains a summary of available user default
        values that one can set to control the operation of the GNUstep
        libraries.
      </p>
<h3><a name ="cont-1">GUI Library Defaults</a></h3>
<p>

      Below is a list of defaults used to control the gnustep-gui library.
      </p>
<dl>
<dt>GSBackend
<dd>
          <p>

          A string containing the name of the backend bundle to use
          for display specific GUI handling. The default is
          "libgnustep-xgps.bundle". Currently the only other choice is
          "libgnustep-xdps.bundle".
          </p>

	  
<dt>GSBrowserCellFontify
<dd>
          <p>

          A boolean value, <code>NO</code> by default.  When the feature is on,
          NSBrowserCell draws non-leaf cells in bold system font.
          For example, when the feature is on, in a SavePanel (or OpenPanel),
          directory entries are drawn in bold, while simple files are drawn in
          non bold.
          </p>

	  
<dt>GSSavePanelShowProgress
<dd>
          <p>

          A boolean value, <code>NO</code> by default.  When the
          feature is on, the save panel and its subclasses (such as
          the open panel) displays "Reading Directory ***.."
          (progressively adding dots) in the window titlebar while
          reading very big directories (more than 100 entries).  This
          is meant to make things friendlier for slow computers. Not
          well tested.
          </p>

	  
<dt>GSLogWorkspaceTimeout
<dd>
          <p>

          A boolean value that defaults to <code>NO</code>. This is a
          obscure and probably not useful default. NSWorkspace tries
          to receive distributed notifications, but if a distributed
          objects server cannot be found or some other error occurs,
          it raises an exception which normally terminates the
          program. Setting this default causes NSWorkspace to just log
          the problem without raising an exception.
          </p>

	  
<dt>NSInterfaceStyleDefault
<dd>
          <p>

          A string describing the interface style. Setting this may
          change various aspects of how the library draws elements and
          responds to user interaction. See the NSInterfaceStyle
          documentation for more information.
          </p>

	  
<dt>NSMenuInterfaceStyle
<dd>
          <p>

          An interface style specific to menu operation. See
          NSInterfaceStyleDefault.
          </p>

	  
<dt>NSCommandKeys
<dd>
          <p>

          A dictionary of command key equivalents for menu items. The
          key contains the title of the menu item and the value is the
          command key equivalent. For instance, one might set the
          command key for the menu item "Copy" to "C".
          </p>

	  
<dt>NSHost
<dd>
          <p>

          Used by NSPasteboard to find the host on which the
          pasteboard server is running.
          </p>

	  
<dt>NSMeasurementUnit
<dd>
          <p>

          A string describing the measurement unit for rulers (see the
          NSRulerView class documentation). The default is
          Centimeters. Other possible values are Inches, Points, and Picas.
          </p>

	  
<dt><em>System Colors</em>
<dd>
          <p>

          System colors may be set using the defaults system. System
          colors are standard colors for drawing various GUI elements,
          such as buttons, text, scroller, etc. The value is a
          dictionary describing the color. The keys that can be
          used for setting the system colors are described in the
          documentation for NSColor.
          </p>

	  
<dt><em>System Fonts</em>
<dd>
          <p>

          System Fonts may be set using the defaults system. System
          fonts are standard fonts for drawing text in GUI
          elements. They include NSBoldFont, for instance. The value
          is the name of the font to use. There is also a
          cooresponding size key (e.g. NSBoldFontSize) for specifying
          the point size of the font. The keys that can be used for
          setting the system fonts are described in the documentation
          for NSFont.
          </p>

<h3><a name ="cont-2">XGPS Backend Defaults</a></h3>
<p>

      Below is a list of defaults used to control the gnustep-xgps
      backend. These defaults generally control system specific
      display and user interaction options which may not be available
      on all systems.
      </p>
<dl>
<dt>NSDefaultVisual
<dd>
          <p>

          An integer that specifies the X-Windows visual class to use
          in the application. For instance one could display the
          application using the PsuedoColor visual class by setting
          the value to the id of this class. The default is the
          X-Windows default visual class.
          </p>

	  
<dt>NSColorsPerChannel
<dd>
          <p>

          An integer which limits the maximum number of colors to
          display, per channel. For a psuedo-color display, this would
          limit the total number of colors that the application could
          use (normally 256). For a true-color display, this would
          limit the range of red, green, and blue values that could be used.
          </p>

	  
<dt>XGPS-Shm
<dd>
          <p>

          A boolean value which defaults to <code>YES</code> (as long as shared
          memory is available). If set to <code>NO</code>, shared memory is not
          used for various display specific operations.
          </p>

	  
<dt>GSFontAntiAlias
<dd>
          <p>

          A boolean value which defaults to <code>NO</code>. If set to
          <code>YES</code> and the X-Windows system has the XFT
          extension, then the application will use anti-aliased fonts
          as provided by the X-Windows system.
          </p>

	  
<dt>GraphicCompositing
<dd>
          <p>

          A boolean value which defaults to <code>NO</code>. If set to
          <code>YES</code>, then the application uses various tricks
          to get alpha colors to work when compositing images. This
          may slow down drawing of images, but it is generally
          recommended anyway, particularly on fast systems.
