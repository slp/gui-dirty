Most of these files are generated automatically from the
source using the autogsdoc program. Don't edit these files
directly. Add comments and documentation directly to the source file. Then
from the source directory, run

make doc=yes

and copy all the files in the Gui subdirectory to here.

The DTD describing the gsdoc documentation markup language can be found
in the GSDoc directory.
