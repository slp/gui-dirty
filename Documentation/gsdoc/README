Skeleton class documentation in gsdoc format.

Run the gsdoc tool giving it the names of the .gsdoc files in this directory
in order to generate html output.

To build/install the gsdoc tool - see the core/base/GSDoc directory.

The DTD describing the gsdoc documentation markup language can be found
in the GSDoc directory.

Note that most of these files are generated automatically from the
source using the autogsdoc program. Don't edit these files
directly. Add comments and documentation directly to the source file
