@section Classes

Currently none of the classes raise exceptions.

@table @strong

@item NSActionCell:: [9]
Should not require any implementation in the
backend as it is an abstract class which only defines behaviour.  All
methods are implemented; the only thing lacking is a test, if needed.

@item NSApplication:: [6]
The event handling is pretty good though it
does not take advantage of the NSRunLoop class.  Many of the minor
methods are implemented.  No window ordering is being maintained, and
a number of the methods that perform operations on windows are
empty.  Modal loops are not implemented.

@item NSBitmapImageRep:: [4]
Implementation has been filled out enough so that TIFF images can be
displayed; its possible that not all TIFF image types are handled yet as
the backend implementation must deal with each of them.  No compression
nor generation of TIFF representations.

@item NSBox:: [8] 
Many of the methods have code, but whether the class
is usable depends upon how much implementation has been done in the
backend.

@item NSBrowser:: [2]

@item NSBrowserCell:: [2]

@item NSButton:: [9]
Repeat intervals and key equivalents not
implemented.  There should be little need for backend implementation
as NSButton is mainly behavior; its cell class does all drawing.

@item NSButtonCell:: [9]
This class is basically complete; repeat intervals and key equivalents need
to be implemented to finalize the class.

@item NSCachedImageRep:: [4]
All methods are implemented but its unknown if the class works.

@item NSCell:: [8]
No determination of component sizes.  Editing
text, validating input, represented object, and some other odd and end
methods not implemented.

@item NSClipView:: [2]

@item NSColor:: [8]
Now implements all colorspaces; however, does not know the difference
between calibrated and device.

@item NSColorList:: [9]
Implementation should be fairly complete; may need some work for reading
and writing color list files.

@item NSColorPanel:: [2]

@item NSColorPicker:: [2]

@item NSColorWell:: [9]
Implementation should be fairly complete; backend implementation required
for the actual drawing of the control.

@item NSControl:: [8]
No field editor; doesn't know how to calculate its size.

@item NSCursor:: [8]
Implementation should be fairly complete; backend implementation required
to be usable.  May not handle user specified images.

@item NSCustomImageRep:: [4]
All methods are implemented but it is unknown if the class works.

@item NSDataLink:: [2]

@item NSDataLinkManager:: [2]

@item NSDataLinkPanel:: [2]

@item NSDPSContext:: [6]
Enough implementation for the backend to do
something useful; most methods that deal specifically with Display
Ghostscript are empty.

@item NSEPSImageRep:: [2]

@item NSEvent:: [9]
All methods implemented except periodic events.

@item NSFont:: [9]
Now maintains AFM and glyph information but requires the backend
implementation to supply it.

@item NSFontManager:: [6]
Has been filled out some more so as to be usable with the Display
Ghostscript System, but still requires additional work.

@item NSFontPanel:: [2]
May be usable with backend implementation.

@item NSForm:: [2]

@item NSFormCell:: [2]

@item NSHelpPanel:: [2]

@item NSImage:: [8]
Additional implementation to the point where TIFF images can be
displayed; requires sufficient backend implementation in the NSImageRep
classes.

@item NSImageRep:: [8]
Additional implementation to the point where TIFF images can be
displayed; requires sufficient backend implementation.

@item NSMatrix:: [6]
Many methods are implemented but more thorough testing needs to be done.

@item NSMenu:: [2]
Implementation was removed until a more efficient mechanism can be
devised.  The OpenStep specification has changed regarding this class.

@item NSMenuCell:: [8]
Almost complete implementation; actual ability to use depends upon
backend implementation.

@item NSOpenPanel:: [6]
Usability greatly depends upon backend implementation.

@item NSPageLayout:: [2]

@item NSPanel:: [2]

@item NSPasteboard:: [2]

@item NSPopUpButton:: [4]
Usability greatly depends upon backend implementation.

@item NSPrinter:: [2]

@item NSPrintinfo:: [2]

@item NSPrintOperation:: [2]

@item NSPrintPanel:: [2]

@item NSResponder:: [9]
Shouldn't require any backend implementation; all methods are implemented.

@item NSSavePanel:: [6]
Usability greatly depends upon backend implementation.

@item NSScreen:: [6]
Knows nothing about window depth, greatly depends upon backend implementation.

@item NSScroller:: [9]
Filled out implementation so that it should be almost complete; requires
backend implementation of a few methods.

@item NSScrollView:: [2]

@item NSSelection:: [2]

@item NSSlider:: [4]
Usability greatly depends upon backend implementation.

@item NSSliderCell:: [6]
No title or image capability implemented, greatly depends upon backend.

@item NSSpellChecker:: [2]

@item NSSpellServer:: [2]

@item NSSplitView:: [2]

@item NSText:: [2]
Usability greatly depends upon backend implementation.

@item NSTextField:: [8]
Does not properly send text delegate messages.

@item NSTextFieldCell:: [4]
Usability greatly depends upon backend implementation.

@item NSView:: [6] 
Maintains subview lists, notification of new window, send resizing
messages to subviews.  Rotation, scaling, or translation of user
coordinate space depends upon backend implementation.  Event handling
and tracking rectangles implemented.  Cursor management implemented.  No
scrolling capability.  No printing, paging, or postscript.

@item NSWindow:: [4]
Most methods not implemented, but maybe usable with backend implementation.

@item NSWorkspace:: [2]
