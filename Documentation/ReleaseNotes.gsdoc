      <heading>Gui Release Notes</heading>
      <p>
        The release notes include descriptions of API changes, behavior
	changes and other information that might help developers and users
	migrate to using a newer version of the library.
      </p>
      <section>
	<heading>Version 0.10.0</heading>
	<p>
	    The interface version of the gui library has changed in
	    this release.  Applications, libraries and tools that
	    wish to use this new version must be recompiled
	    (otherwise, they'll use the older version of the library).
	</p>
	  <deflist>
	    <term>Nib window autopositioning</term>
	    <desc>
	    Nib loading has been improved to handle auto-positioning
	    of windows.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSFont</term>
	    <desc>
	    An ivar was added to NSFont to cache flipped fonts.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSApplication</term>
	    <desc>
	    An ivar was added to track application launch.
	    </desc>
	    <term>Keyed Encoding</term>
	    <desc>
	    Work was done in many classes to support keyed
	    encoding. It may not be fully implemented in every class, however.
	    </desc>

      <section>
	<heading>Version 0.9.5</heading>
	<p>
	</p>
	  <deflist>
	    <term>NSColor colors</term>
	    <desc>
	    Added new control colors and methods from 10.3 version of Cocoa.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSFont methods</term>
	    <desc>
	    Added new font methods from 10.3 version of Cocoa
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSApplication -runModalSession</term>
	    <desc>
	    Behavior of this method was changed. In particular it deviates
	    from Cocoa documentation. See the GNUstep GUI documentation for
	    specifics.
	    </desc>
	    <term>Runtime version discovery of library</term>
	    <desc>
	    A developer can discover the version of the gui library
            that is loaded using the NSBundle methods <code>[[NSBundle
            bundleForLibrary: @"gnustep-gui"] infoDictionary]</code>
            and retrieving the <var>GSBundleVersion</var> key.

      <section>
	<heading>Version 0.9.4</heading>
	<p>
	</p>
	  <deflist>
	    <term>Interface version change</term>
	    <desc>
	    The interface version of the gui library has changed in
	    this release.
	    There is no single reason for this change. Arguably, it
	    should have been done long ago. In the future the
	    interface version will only change with releases that
	    have a new minor version number (that's the second number in the
	    release number). Applications, libraries and tools that
	    wish to use this new version must be recompiled
	    (otherwise, they'll use the older version of the library).
	    </desc>
	    <term>PPD's removed</term>
	    <desc>
	      All the PPD's have been removed from the gui library
	      into a separate package (gnustep-ppd). There still
	      exists a single Generic Postscript Printer PPD which
	      should work in many cases for printing using the
	      standard <var>lpr</var> interface. In the future, a
	      <var>CUPS</var> interface should be available that provides
	      all the necessary printer information automatically. If
	      you still want use of the PPD's, you must install the
	      gnustep-ppd package, although this is not required for
	      use of gnustep-gui.
	    </desc>
	    <term>Printing framework</term>
	    <desc>
	      The printing framework was generalized to allow for
	      various types of native printing systems. The lpr
	      system is the only complete one, although CUPS printing
	      is in the works. As such, the printing classes were
	      revamped to handle this, and the actual system-specific
	      code is loaded from a bundle.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSScroller, NSScrollView class size change</term>
	    <desc>
	      A new ivar was added to the NSScroller and NSScrollView classes.
	    </desc>

	<heading>Version 0.9.3</heading>
	<p>
	</p>
	  <deflist>
	    <term>Spell checker daemon reimplemented using libaspell</term>
	    <desc>
	      If the optional library libaspell is found, the spell checker
	      will use it (otherwise spell checking will not work).
	    </desc>
	    <term>New NSComboBox implementation</term>
	    <desc>
	      NSComboBox and related classes have been re-implemented
	      and documented.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSToolbar code redone</term>
	    <desc>
	      A lot of changes where made to the NSToolbar class to 
	      make it more functional.
	    </desc>
	    <term>Binary Incompatibilities</term>
	    <desc>
	      New ivars were added NSTableView, NSView,
	      NSSavePanel. Applications that use this class and
	      subclasses (e.g. NSOutlineView) may need to be
	      recompiled to work properly.
