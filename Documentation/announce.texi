This is version @value{GNUSTEP-GUI-VERSION} of the GNUstep GUI library (@samp{gnustep-gui}).

@section What is the GNUstep GUI Library?

It is a library of graphical user interface classes written completely 
in the Objective-C language; the classes are based upon the OpenStep
specification as release by NeXT Software, Inc.  The library has been
enhanced in a number of ways to take advantage of the GNU system.  
These classes include graphical objects such as buttons, text fields, 
popup lists, browser lists, and windows; there are also many associated 
classes for handling events, colors, fonts, pasteboards and images.

The GNUstep GUI Library is designed in two parts.  The first part is the
front-end component which is independent of platform and display system.
This front-end is combined with a back-end component which handles all of
the display system dependent such as specific calls to X/Windows.  This
design allows the GNUstep applications to have the "look and feel" of
the underlying display system without any changes to the application, and
the library can be easily ported to other display systems.

The GNUstep GUI Library requires the GNU Objective-C compiler, the
GNUstep Base Library, the TIFF Graphics library, and a back-end
component like the GNUstep X/GPS GUI Backend.

@section Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?

@ifset GNUSTEP-GUI-FTP-MACHINE
The gstep-gui-@value{GNUSTEP-GUI-VERSION}.tar.gz distribution
file has been placed on @samp{@value{GNUSTEP-GUI-FTP-MACHINE}} in
@samp{@value{GNUSTEP-GUI-FTP-DIRECTORY}}.
@end ifset

the TIFF Graphics library version
@value{GNUSTEP-GUI-LIBTIFF} is required.

It also requires a FoundationKit library as specified by the OpenStep
specification.  The FoundationKit libraries known to work are the GNUstep
Base Library.
