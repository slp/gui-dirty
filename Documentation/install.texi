This file documents the installation of the GNUstep GUI Library,
@samp{gnustep-gui}. If you are installing this package as part of the
GNUstep core package, read the file GNUstep-HOWTO for more complete
instructions on how to install the entire GNUstep package (including
this library).  GNUstep-HOWTO is located at @url{http://www.gnustep.org}
and in the gnustep-make package (which you should install first).

You must have installed gnustep-base and gnustep-make 
before building this library.

After installing this library, install gnustep-xgps.

@section Configuration

Configuration is performed by running the @file{configure} program at a
shell prompt. You may want to use some of the optional arguments to the
@file{configure} program. Type @code{configure --help} for a list. GNUstep
specific options are at the end of this list (if any).

@node Compilation, Installing, Configuration, Top
@section Compilation

To compile this library, type make. After this is complete, type make
install (make sure you are the root user). Some additional options you
can use with make are @samp{debug=yes} to make a debugging version of
the library and @samp{shared=no} to make a static version of the
library. See the gstep-make package for more information on these options.
