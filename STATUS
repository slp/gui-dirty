Classes
=======

   Currently none of the classes raise exceptions.

*NSActionCell:: [9]*
     Should not require any implementation in the backend as it is an
     abstract class which only defines behaviour.  All methods are
     implemented; the only thing lacking is a test, if needed.

*NSApplication:: [6]*
     The event handling has been integrated with the NSRunLoop class.
     Many of the minor methods are implemented.  No window ordering is
     being maintained, and a number of the methods that perform
     operations on windows are empty.  Modal loops are not implemented.

*NSBitmapImageRep:: [4]*
     Implementation has been filled out enough so that TIFF images can
     be displayed; its possible that not all TIFF image types are
     handled yet as the backend implementation must deal with each of
     them.  No compression nor generation of TIFF representations.

*NSBox:: [8]*
     Many of the methods have code, but whether the class is usable
     depends upon how much implementation has been done in the backend.

*NSBrowser:: [2]*
*NSBrowserCell:: [2]*
*NSButton:: [9]*
     Repeat intervals and key equivalents not implemented.  There
     should be little need for backend implementation as NSButton is
     mainly behavior; its cell class does all drawing.

*NSButtonCell:: [9]*
     This class is basically complete; repeat intervals and key
     equivalents need to be implemented to finalize the class.

*NSCachedImageRep:: [4]*
     All methods are implemented but its unknown if the class works.

*NSCell:: [8]*
     No determination of component sizes.  Editing text, validating
     input, represented object, and some other odd and end methods not
     implemented.

*NSClipView:: [2]*
*NSColor:: [8]*
     Now implements all colorspaces; however, does not know the
     difference between calibrated and device.

*NSColorList:: [9]*
     Implementation should be fairly complete; may need some work for
     reading and writing color list files.

*NSColorPanel:: [2]*
*NSColorPicker:: [2]*
*NSColorWell:: [9]*
     Implementation should be fairly complete; backend implementation
     required for the actual drawing of the control.

*NSControl:: [8]*
     No field editor; doesn't know how to calculate its size.

*NSCursor:: [8]*
     Implementation should be fairly complete; backend implementation
     required to be usable.  May not handle user specified images.

*NSCustomImageRep:: [4]*
     All methods are implemented but it is unknown if the class works.

*NSDataLink:: [2]*
*NSDataLinkManager:: [2]*
*NSDataLinkPanel:: [2]*
*NSDPSContext:: [6]*
     Enough implementation for the backend to do something useful; most
     methods that deal specifically with Display Ghostscript are empty.

*NSEPSImageRep:: [2]*
*NSEvent:: [9]*
     All methods implemented except periodic events.

*NSFont:: [9]*
     Now maintains AFM and glyph information but requires the backend
     implementation to supply it.

*NSFontManager:: [6]*
     Has been filled out some more so as to be usable with the Display
     Ghostscript System, but still requires additional work.

*NSFontPanel:: [2]*
     May be usable with backend implementation.

*NSForm:: [9]*
     The code has been written, it greatly depends on NSMatrix, but no
     tests have been made.

*NSFormCell:: [2]*
*NSHelpPanel:: [2]*
*NSImage:: [8]*
     Additional implementation to the point where TIFF images can be
     displayed; requires sufficient backend implementation in the
     NSImageRep classes.

*NSImageRep:: [8]*
     Additional implementation to the point where TIFF images can be
     displayed; requires sufficient backend implementation.

*NSMatrix:: [9]*
     The class is almost completely implemented, only the methods that
     deal with text selection and moving from a text field to another
     using TAB and SHIFT-TAB are empty.

*NSMenu:: [10]*
     The class is complete now, all the logic is here, the backend
     needs to write only the code that deals with displaying the menu
     windows on screen. For an example of how this is achieved take a
     look to the XDPS backend.

*NSMenuItem:: [10]*
     The logic is here, but needs support for drawing the cell in the
     backend. Also take a look to the XDPS backend to see how this
     works.

*NSOpenPanel:: [6]*
     Usability greatly depends upon backend implementation.

*NSPageLayout:: [2]*
*NSPanel:: [2]*
*NSPasteboard:: [2]*
*NSPopUpButton:: [4]*
     Usability greatly depends upon backend implementation.

*NSPrinter:: [9]*
     The code was written but not tested very much. We also need to add
     printer description files to the PrinterTypes directory inside the
     gnustep instalation directory.

*NSPrintinfo:: [2]*
*NSPrintOperation:: [2]*
*NSPrintPanel:: [2]*
*NSResponder:: [9]*
     Shouldn't require any backend implementation; all methods are
     implemented.

*NSSavePanel:: [6]*
     Usability greatly depends upon backend implementation.

*NSScreen:: [6]*
     Knows nothing about window depth, greatly depends upon backend
     implementation.

*NSScroller:: [9]*
     Filled out implementation so that it should be almost complete;
     requires backend implementation of a few methods.

*NSScrollView:: [2]*
*NSSelection:: [2]*
*NSSlider:: [4]*
     Usability greatly depends upon backend implementation.

*NSSliderCell:: [6]*
     No title or image capability implemented, greatly depends upon
     backend.

*NSSpellChecker:: [2]*
*NSSpellServer:: [2]*
*NSSplitView:: [2]*
*NSText:: [2]*
     Usability greatly depends upon backend implementation.

*NSTextField:: [8]*
     Does not properly send text delegate messages.

*NSTextFieldCell:: [4]*
     Usability greatly depends upon backend implementation.

*NSView:: [6]*
     Maintains subview lists, notification of new window, send resizing
     messages to subviews.  Rotation, scaling, or translation of user
     coordinate space depends upon backend implementation.  Event
     handling and tracking rectangles implemented.  Cursor management
     implemented.  No scrolling capability.  No printing, paging, or
     postscript.

*NSWindow:: [4]*
     Most methods not implemented, but maybe usable with backend
     implementation.

*NSWorkspace:: [2]*
Protocols
=========

*NSChangeSpelling:: [9]*
*NSColorPickingCustom:: [9]*
*NSColorPickingDefault:: [9]*
*NSDraggingDestination:: [9]*
*NSDraggingInfo:: [9]*
*NSDraggingSource:: [9]*
*NSIgnoreMisspelledWords:: [9]*
*NSMenuActionResponder:: [9]*
*NSNibAwaking:: [9]*
*NSServicesRequests:: [9]*
Functions
=========

   All of the functions have been moved to the backend.
