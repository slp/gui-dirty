Bugs in the GUI library
=======================

Windows
-------

   * Code to manage window decorations is not finished.  The reported
     frame origin of a window might be wrong.

   * Windows never get released.  Setting isReleasedWhenClosed does not
     work.

     Fixing these bugs requires touching delicate parts of the library.
     This is why fixing them has been postponed after 0.6.5, to keep
     0.6.5 reasonably stable.

Texts
-----

   * The NSText code is particularly complex to work on and it has not
     improved much since 0.6.0.  Many bugs are know in the code - it is
     somewhat usable though.  We hope on a big improvement of this area
     for next release.

Matrices
--------

   * Encoding/Decoding of matrices is unimplemented.  There are some
     minor known bugs with handling of mouse down in matrices.

Cells
-----

   * Since NSText does only left alignment, when you select or edit text
     in a cell it becomes automatically left aligned regardless of the
     original alignment.

   * Multi line texts are unsupported; isScrollable, wordWraps etc do
     nothing.  This restriction will hopefully be removed in next
     releases.

Images anf Graphics
-------------------

   * There are problems with alpha composing.  To avoid these problems,
     you may set manually the background color of your image when
     displaying it.

   * Only TIFF images are supported in 0.6.5.  Support at least for PNG
     and JPEG images is planned for next release.

   * alpha drawing and compositing of graphics doesn't work.


Alert, Info Panels
------------------

   * Multi line messages are generally unsupported due to the similar
     restriction in the cells code.

Unimplemented Classes
---------------------

   The following classes are currently unimplemented or unfinished to
such a degree to be unusable.

   * NSColorPanel

   * NSDataLink

   * NSFontManager

   * NSFontPanel

   * NSHelpPanel

   * NSLayoutManager

   * NSPageLayout

   * NSPrintPanel

   * NSSecureTextField

   * NSSpellChecker

   * NSTableView

   * NSTextView
