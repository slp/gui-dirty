Bugs in the GUI library
=======================

Windows
-------

   * Getting and releasing keyboard focus is still buggy. This is mostly
     annoying for users trying to type in a GNUstep or non-GNUstep
     window.


Texts
-----

   * There have been a lot of improvements in the NSText code, but is
     particularly complex. It is somewhat usable though.  We hope to
     keep improving it.


Matrices
--------

   * Encoding/Decoding of matrices is unimplemented.  There are some
     minor known bugs with handling of mouse down in matrices.

Cells
-----

   * Since NSText does only left alignment, when you select or edit text
     in a cell it becomes automatically left aligned regardless of the
     original alignment.

   * Multi line texts are unsupported; isScrollable, wordWraps etc do
     nothing.  This restriction will hopefully be removed in next
     releases.

Images anf Graphics
-------------------

   * There are problems with alpha composing.  To avoid these problems,
     you may set manually the background color of your image when
     displaying it.

   * alpha drawing and compositing of graphics works, but only to a
     limited degree.


Alert, Info Panels
------------------

   * Multi line messages are generally unsupported due to the similar
     restriction in the cells code.

Unimplemented Classes
---------------------

   The following classes are currently unimplemented or unfinished to
such a degree to be unusable.

   * NSDataLink

   * NSHelpPanel

   * NSLayoutManager

   * NSPageLayout

   * NSPrintPanel

   * NSSecureTextField

   * NSSpellChecker
